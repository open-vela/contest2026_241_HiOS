- Added `esp_gmf_pool_get_io_tag_by_url` to support dynamic IO selection based on URL
- Added `get_score` callback to `esp_gmf_io_t` to support URL-based scoring mechanism

### Bug Fixes

- `esp_gmf_element_process_open`: allows the first element's IN port to be NULL, still checks that non-last elements have a non-NULL OUT port
- `esp_gmf_task_run`: clears any left-over PAUSE/STOP event bits before running to prevent issues for the current run
- Fixed block data bus read data wrong in corner case
- Fixed reuse pipeline crash if task stop timeout
